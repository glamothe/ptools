Documentation
-------------

The documentation is provided in the 'Tutorial/doc' directory. Simply run 'make' in this directory 
to get a pdf documentation.

Source code may be parsed by an automatic documentation generator called 'Doxygen'.
This documentation may only help for the C++ part of the library.
after installing Doxygen, simply type 'doxygen' in the directory which contains the 'Doxyfile'.
Then look into the html/ directory and find the index.html file generated...


Very quick setup guide
-----------------------

This is the very minimal set of instructions required to install Ptools
in a Python virtual environment.
It assumes all Ptools dependencies have been duly installed::

    $ virtualenv ptools-env
    $ source ptools-env/bin/activate
    (ptools-env) $ pip install cython
    (ptools-env) $ git clone https://github.com/ptools/ptools.git    
    (ptools-env) $ cd ptools
    (ptools-env) $ python setup.py install

A more detailed version is in the official tutorial. 


About Git branches:
--------------------
